# Installation
I'll upload already built executables to the [releases](https://github.com/V1li/H4X-Tools/releases) tab, 
but I'd recommend installing the tool manually by following the instructions below. This way you also get the freshest version.

## Setup
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
>
> view the [wiki page](https://github.com/V1li/H4X-Tools/wiki) for more detailed tutorial.

### Linux
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/v1li/h4x-tools.git`

2. Change directory `cd h4x-tools`

3. Run `sh setup.sh` in terminal to install the tool.

### Windows
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/v1li/h4x-tools.git`

2. Change directory `cd h4x-tools`

3. Run the `setup.bat` file.

Setup files will automatically build the tool as an executable.
You can also run the tool using `python h4xtools.py` in the terminal.

Also, dependencies can be installed manually using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After running the web version of the tool, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use it.
